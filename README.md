HTML5-rework contains two crucial components that provide a solid, minimal, and complete foundation for your next web project:

1) A single page, style.html, detailing EVERY HTML5 block element (courtesy of [HTML5 Test Page](https://github.com/cbracco/html5-test-page))
2) A complete HTML5 style reset (courtesy of [HTML5 Reset](https://github.com/murtaugh/HTML5-Reset))

This repo is not a framework, it is not a design package, it is not a template, it is simply a collection of files which create the most basic starting point for your next website, and on top of that, provides some simple resources to get you started with your design. This repo is also not simply a repackaging of other people's work. I have reworked both [HTML5 Test Page](https://github.com/cbracco/html5-test-page) and [HTML5 Reset](https://github.com/murtaugh/HTML5-Reset) to conform to best practices while reducing file sizes, simplifying styles, and scaffolding a mobile-first approach to the stylesheet syntax (among other changes).

The intent of this repo is to provide a foundation for new projects that includes a concise library of resources completely eliminate any web defaults, establishing a simple mobile responsive website skeleton, and providing resources to keep your project organized.
